iOS-Development Podcasts
===================

![Podcasts](podcasts.png "Some Podcasts, as Seen in iCatcher")

The following is a list of podcasts of interest to iOS developers. Frequencies are approximate. Average length is of the past three episodes. Corrections and suggestions are welcome.

I am in the process of adding separate fields for RSS versus URL, plus Twitter. For shows that do not have dedicated Twitter accounts, hosts' accounts are listed.

The addition of fields is complete up to `Debug`.
